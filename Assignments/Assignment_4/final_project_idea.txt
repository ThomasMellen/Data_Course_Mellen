i worked on a project relating to beetle horn allometry and i found one of those old papers and i found a dataset in their supplementary files i think will work for this classes final project. 

the paper is here https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2023.08.066 and the dataset is comparing beetle sample location to body size to horn length, thereby ginving us allometry. 

my idea for the project is to take this dataset and make a bunch of graphs that compare the location of the sample to the allometry of the horns to see if i cant find a trend that looks nice. 

the data is just an xml file and it just has numbers and names of places inside, i have the file downloaded on my pc but heres the OSF link to download it https://osf.io/dczfx/files/5vscp .
